Humans & Plant Technology
Dear CTC (@ctc_rfof) community, We are pleased to announce that we will be combining and merging all projects from our five communities. Our goal is to make groundbreaking advances in biomedical research, particularly in the areas of cancer healing and the combination of plant and human stem cells. **Our main goals:** 1. **Research to cure cancer**: We will work intensively to advance the cure of cancer through innovative biomedical projects. 2. **Stem cell research**: By fusing plant and human stem cells, we want to develop and research an immune system that is more resistant to susceptible diseases. 3. **Cannabis as a medicine**: We are committed to researching cannabis as a medicine. Although cannabis is still a largely unexplored medicinal product, studies show that it may have anti-cancer properties, similar to broccoli and nettles. These combined efforts are intended to not only revolutionize our understanding of cancer and immune systems, but also to further investigate the potential healing properties of natural plants, particularly cannabis. Together we can achieve great things! Your BUBATZ (@bubatzclub_) team
